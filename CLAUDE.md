# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Czech sci-fi short story project called "KMOTRA SMRT" (Death Godmother) - a modern sci-fi adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale "Der Gevatter Tod". The story follows Dr. Martin Třináctý, a young doctor who gains access to an AI system called THANATOS that can predict patient deaths with 99.7% accuracy.

## Content Architecture

### Story Framework
- **Genre**: Sci-fi thriller with technological horror elements
- **Length**: 8-12 standard pages (14,400 - 21,600 characters)
- **Target audience**: Adult sci-fi/fantasy readers
- **Structure**: 3-act structure with detailed scene breakdown

### Key Components

1. **GUIDELINES.md**: Master document containing:
   - Complete character profiles (Dr. Martin Třináctý, THANATOS AI, Prof. Eva Bohatá, Ing. Petr Ďábel)
   - Detailed 9-scene plot structure across 3 acts
   - Thematic elements and symbolism
   - Writing style guidelines
   - Technical specifications for publication

2. **scenes/**: Directory containing individual scene files
   - Each scene written as separate markdown file
   - Scene 1 already implemented with rich atmospheric detail
   - Future scenes to follow the structure outlined in GUIDELINES.md

## Writing Guidelines

### Style Requirements
- **Atmospheric writing**: Emphasis on sterile hospital environment vs. organic humanity
- **Minimalist descriptions**: Focus on atmosphere over excessive detail
- **Dialog-driven narrative**: Key information delivered through conversations
- **Technical vs. emotional language**: AI speaks clinically, Martin emotionally
- **Czech language**: All content written in Czech

### Character Voice Consistency
- **THANATOS**: Calm, objective, sometimes ironic AI voice
- **Martin**: Idealistic, emotional, increasingly conflicted
- **Environment**: Futuristic medical setting (year 2045)

### Technical Specifications
- 1 standard page = 1,800 characters including spaces
- Act I: 25% (2-3 pages)
- Act II: 50% (4-6 pages) 
- Act III: 25% (2-3 pages)

## Development Commands

Since this is a creative writing project rather than a software project, there are no build, test, or lint commands. Work primarily involves:

- Reading and editing markdown files
- Maintaining consistency with GUIDELINES.md
- Following the established story structure and character development

## Content Management

When working on this project:
1. Always reference GUIDELINES.md for character consistency and plot structure
2. Follow the established atmospheric and stylistic guidelines
3. Maintain the three-act structure with specific scene requirements
4. Preserve the sci-fi medical setting and terminology
5. Keep the moral dilemmas and themes consistent with the source fairy tale adaptation

## File Naming Convention

- Scene files: `scene-X.md` where X is the scene number
- Use descriptive titles within the files matching GUIDELINES.md structure
- Maintain Czech language throughout all content
